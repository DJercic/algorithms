# Highest product

Given an array of N integers, find the highest product by multiplying 3 elements.

Constraints:
    - 3 <= N <= 1e5
    - A[i] = [-1e5, 1e5]

Example:
    - [1, 2, 3, 4] => expected: 24
    - [1, 2, 3, -4] => expected: 6
    - [-1, -2, -3, -4] => expected: -6
    - [-1, -2, -3, 4] => expected: 24
